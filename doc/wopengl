WOPENGL

	wopengl module should export two main objects, the shape
	manager and the plant manager, those are the ones used by
	the modules.

	wicom loads wopengl module and takes care of calling it for
	unintialization but the design itself is using shapemgr and
	plantmgr.

	See wopengl.shapemgr and wopengl.plantmgr files for more
	information about these objects.
