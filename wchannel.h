   Module Description

   This module is an interface between wicom and comunication Sockets.
   It should have only 4 basic functions exported: create, send, recv
   and destroy.

   It should be possible to bind the socket to a specific port and to
   specify interface, protocol and ip version to use. Default is ipv6.

   Hosts should be refered by hostname instead of IP addresses.

   No information of the host that sent the message is returned to the
   client application (this includes host address and port used to send
   the packet).

   It will be very helpful to have a way of tracing the messages
   exchanged between modules for debugging and troubleshooting issues.
   When creating the channel, the client might fill the options structure
   with the informations of how big will be buffer be (in messages).
   To consult the messages in the buffer, the client calls a specific
   function to peek messages from the message buffer. It might be
   possible also to configure the channel so that each message
   received or sent is dumped to the stdout.

   Example of usage:

   wchannel_t wch;
   wchannel_opt_t wch_opt = { .type = WCHANNEL_TYPE_SOCKUDP,
		.debug_opt = WCHANNEL_NO_DEBUG };
   char *host_src = "localhost";
   
   memcpy(wch_opt.host_src,host_src,sizeof(host_src));

   ws = wchannel_create(&wch_opt,&wch);
   if( ws != WSTATUS_SUCCESS ) { ... }

   ws = wchannel_send(wch,"10.0.0.1:1234","HELLO WORLD",10,0);
   if( ws != WSTATUS_SUCCESS ) { ... }

   ws = wchannel_destroy(wch);
